### Status
The project is a work in progress. Hopefully, it can showcase the power of progressive web apps, as a future solution for a consistent experience across devices online and offline.

### Background
This project was created in a weekend a few months back after frustration from currently available desktop calculators and alternative PWA ones that fail to keep up with UI standards, e.g. Gnome's calculator.
